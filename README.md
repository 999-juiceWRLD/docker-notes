# Docker Notes :D

- Docker is a container platform to develop apps easier by using 
virtualised environments.

- Hence apps are packaged into isolated containers, it's far more easier 
to develop, distribute, maintain and use the target software.

- The main difference of Docker other than virtual machines, that is more 
lightweight, faster and source-friendly.
