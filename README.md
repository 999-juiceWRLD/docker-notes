# Docker Notes :D

- Docker is a container platform to develop apps easier by using
virtualised environments.

- Hence apps are packaged into isolated containers, it's far more easier
to develop, distribute, maintain and use the target software.

- The main difference of Docker other than virtual machines, that is more lightweight, faster and source-friendly.

## Â What is a Container?

- Docker containers are a lightweight, virtualised workspaces.

- Each container contains the necessary code, system tools, runtime, libraries and dependencies to run a specific task.

- It is isolated from the main computer or other container working in the main computer.

## Basic Commands

- `docker info`: gives fundamental information about docker, like containers, images, server version, architecture.

- `docker ps`: shows *process status*, where all the containers that are up and running. but `docker ps -a`, as `-a` is short for `-all`, shows both running and stopped containers.

- `docker container ls` and `docker container ls -a` are both lists the containers.
